		<h1>Tim's Page</h1>
		<p>I have been technologically curious since the day my father’s
			14.4k modem dialed up Prodigy. I am now charting a new path towards
			becoming a Full Stack Software Developer. I have an extensive
			background in technical support and am growing my skills at Grand
			Circus learning Java, Git, MVC, JPA/Hibernate, SQL and how to use
			APIs to build a web application. I’m excited to continue learning new
			skills and technologies and apply them on the job everyday.</p>
		<p>I grew up in Huntington Woods, Michigan and have lived in Grand
			Rapids, MI and downtown Detroit. I attended RIT in Rochester, NY but
			now call Auburn Hills, MI home...for now.</p>
